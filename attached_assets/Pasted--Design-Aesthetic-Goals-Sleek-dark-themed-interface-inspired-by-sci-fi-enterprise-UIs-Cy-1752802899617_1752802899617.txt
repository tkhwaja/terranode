  - Current rate
  - Next milestone (progress bar toward goal like "Solar Champion")
- Token ledger with:
  - Amount
  - Type (generation, referral, milestone)
  - Timestamp

---

### Milestones & Badges
- Unlockable titles and badges based on:
  - Uptime streaks
  - Energy generated/exported
  - Referral count
- Display badge progress, unlocked/locked state

---

### Referral System
